Part A

For Part A, I reimagined Piet Mondrian's iconic compositions by adding a neon-inspired twist. Using the pixel data from the original image, I transformed its classic primary colors into vibrant neon shades. Each color—red, yellow, blue, and black—was replaced with a modern counterpart, creating a dynamic, glowing effect. The background was given a gradient, blending smoothly from deep purple to rich blue, adding depth and contrast to the piece.

This piece celebrates Mondrian's focus on balance and structure while introducing a modern, digital aesthetic. By combining pixel manipulation techniques with custom sliders to adjust brightness, I was able to make the artwork interactive and visually captivating.

Part B

For Part B, I explored using the camera feed to create a dynamic and artistic visual experience. The live video was mirrored in real-time, creating symmetry and balance, while colorful waves and chaotic particles brought energy and motion to the composition. The feed itself was subtly distorted, introducing an abstract, dreamlike quality to the visuals.

The interplay between the structured mirrored feed and the chaotic waves and particles reflects a balance between order and creativity. The evolving colors and effects ensure the piece feels alive, making it both mesmerizing and unpredictable. The result is a dynamic fusion of interactivity and art, designed to engage and captivate the viewer
